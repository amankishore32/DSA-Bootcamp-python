### Day1: Big O Notation -> _O(N)_

---

1. **Time Complexity (TC)** - How time grows as input data set (N) grows.
   <br>
   **_O(1)_** - Execution time SAME no matter how large the data set is.<br>
   **_O(N)_** - Time gets doubled if data set doubles.<br>
   **_O(N^2)_** - Danger Zone. If data is doubled, time Quadruples.

2. **Space Complexity (SC)** - How much space is required/consumed for input data set (N).<br>
   **_O(1)_** - No extra space is required. <br>
   **_O(N)_** - Same Extra space as the required as the input. i.e if input is 1GB we need 2GB space to execute.
